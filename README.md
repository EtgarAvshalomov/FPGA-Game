# **Puzzle Game with Stopwatch & LED Control**

## **Overview**

This is a puzzle game designed to combine a stopwatch, memory component, and control mechanisms using buttons and switches on an FPGA (Altera board). The player must control the LEDs by toggling switches (SW7 to SW0) to turn them on or off. The goal is to turn on the relevant LEDs (LED9 to LED4) in the correct configuration, and the time taken to solve the puzzle will be measured and displayed by the stopwatch.

## **How to Play**

1. **Start the Game**: 
   - Press **Button0** to start the stopwatch and begin the puzzle.

2. **Game Objective**: 
   - The player must use switches **SW7 to SW0** to control the LEDs.
   - Each switch controls a specific LED. Toggling a switch will either turn the LED on or off.
   - If an LED is turned off, but the switch controlling it is raised, it will turn on. If itâ€™s on, raising the switch will turn it off.
   - The goal is to turn on only the relevant LEDs (**LED9 to LED4**) by raising the correct switches.

3. **End of Game**: 
   - The game ends when all the correct switches are raised, and the corresponding LEDs are turned on.
   - The stopwatch will stop, and the system will save the time it took to finish the puzzle.

4. **Reset the Game**: 
   - To start a new round, lower all the switches and press **Button1** to reset the stopwatch.

5. **View Last Time**: 
   - To check the last time taken to finish the puzzle, raise **SW8**. The system will display the time taken in the previous round.

6. **LED Reset**: 
   - If there is an issue with turning the LEDs on/off, use **Button2** to reset the LEDs to their default state.
   - To use this feature, lower all the raised switches and press **Button2**. Afterward, you can continue playing as usual.

## **Controls**

- **Button0**: Starts the stopwatch and begins the puzzle.
- **Button1**: Resets the stopwatch for a new round.
- **Button2**: Resets the LEDs to their default state.
- **SW7 to SW0**: Toggle these switches to control the LEDs.
- **SW8**: Raise this switch to see the last time taken to complete the puzzle.

## **Game Logic**

1. When **Button0** is pressed, the stopwatch starts, and the game begins.
2. The player must toggle the switches **SW7 to SW0** to turn the LEDs **LED9 to LED4** on/off in the correct configuration.
3. The stopwatch will stop once the puzzle is completed, and the time will be saved.
4. The game can be reset by lowering all switches and pressing **Button1**.
5. The previous time can be viewed by raising **SW8**.
6. If the LEDs malfunction, the player can reset the LEDs by pressing **Button2** after lowering all the switches.

## **Technical Details**

- **FPGA Board**: `Altera DE0`.
- **Design Software**: Quartus.
